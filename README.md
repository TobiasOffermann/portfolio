# Portfolio

This repository contains a simple static website for my portfolio.

## GitHub Pages

The site is ready to be deployed with GitHub Pages. After pushing to the main branch, enable Pages in your repository settings. GitHub will serve the content from the root of the repository where `index.html` is located.

To preview locally, open `index.html` in your browser.
